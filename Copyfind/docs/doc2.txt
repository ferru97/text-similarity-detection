"our first quarter results reflect our customers' continued strong engagement with the sprouts brand, and the appeal of our fresh, natural and organic products at affordable prices," said amin maredia, chief executive officer of sprouts farmers market. "despite a near zero inflationary environment, our team delivered another solid quarter of comparable store sales growth and robust earnings improvement. we continue to further product innovation, enhance the customer experience, develop our team members and invest in infrastructure and technology, which position sprouts for continued growth."

in order to aid in understanding the company's business performance, it has presented results in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states ("gaap") and has also presented certain non-gaap measures which are explained and reconciled to the gaap measures in the tables included in this release. for 2016 and 2015, the company has presented ebitda and adjusted ebitda, respectively. in addition, for 2015, the company has presented adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share. in each case, an "adjusted" measure excludes the after-tax impact of disposal of assets, store closure and exit costs, and secondary offering expenses. for the first quarter of 2016, such adjustments would be immaterial. accordingly, the company has presented net income, earnings per share and ebitda for the first quarter of 2016 without adjustment and has provided comparisons of such measures to the corresponding adjusted measures from the first quarter of 2015. where applicable, results are first presented on a gaap basis and then on an adjusted basis.

first quarter 2016 financial results

net sales for the first quarter of 2016 were $993.2 million, a 16% increase compared to the same period in 2015. net sales growth was driven by a 4.8% increase in comparable store sales and solid performance in new stores opened.

gross profit for the quarter increased 19% to $306.5 million, resulting in a gross profit margin of 30.9%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to the same period in 2015. this increase reflects higher margins in certain categories primarily due to deflation and more normalized promotions compared to the prior year.

direct store expense ("dse") as a percentage of sales for the quarter increased 50 basis points to 19.5% compared to the same period in 2015. this was primarily due to higher payroll expense from planned wage increases and increased training costs, partially offset by timing of the new year's holiday payroll.

selling, general and administrative expenses ("sg&a") as a percentage of sales for the quarter increased 30 basis points to 3.1%, compared to the same period in 2015. this was primarily driven by higher stock compensation costs due to executive changes and higher corporate overhead as we continue to build out infrastructure to support our growth.

net income for the quarter was $46.2 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.30, up $8.7 million from $37.5 million, or diluted earnings per share of $0.24 for the same period in 2015. excluding the after-tax impact of the loss on disposal of assets, the store closure and exit costs and secondary offering expenses in the first quarter of 2015, net income for the quarter increased 20%, compared to adjusted net income of $38.6 million for the same period in 2015. diluted earnings per share increased 20%, compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.25 for the same period in 2015. these increases were driven by higher sales and margins, the benefit from lower interest expense due to a voluntary pay-down on our revolving credit facility and a more favorable interest rate resulting from our april 2015 refinancing, and a lower effective tax rate.

growth and development

during the first quarter of 2016, we opened 11 new stores: one each in missouri, tennessee and texas; two each in colorado and georgia; and four in california. three additional stores have been opened in the second quarter to date, resulting in a total of 231 stores in 13 states as of may 5, 2016.

leverage and liquidity

we generated cash from operations of $97.9 million for the first quarter of 2016 and invested $31.9 million in capital expenditures net of landlord reimbursement, primarily for new stores. in addition, we purchased $59.3 million of common stock under our $150 million share repurchase program. we ended the quarter with a $160.0 million balance on our revolving credit facility, $1.7 million of letters of credit outstanding under the facility, and $145.7 million in cash and cash equivalents.

2016 outlook

we have adjusted our 2016 net sales growth, primarily due to a lower inflationary environment and timing of new store openings, and confirm our other targets including comparable store sales growth and diluted earnings per share. the following provides information on our guidance for 2016:

in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with gaap, the company has presented ebitda and for 2015, adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted ebitda. these measures are not in accordance with, and are not intended as an alternative to, gaap. the company's management believes that these presentations provide useful information to management, analysts and investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations and financial condition. in addition, management uses these measures for reviewing the financial results of the company, and they are a component of incentive compensation. the company defines ebitda as net income before interest expense, provision for income tax, and depreciation and amortization, and defines adjusted ebitda as ebitda as further adjusted to exclude store closure and exit costs, gains and losses from disposal of assets, and expenses incurred by the company in its secondary public offerings and employment taxes paid by the company in connection with options exercised in those offerings ("public offering expenses") and the loss on extinguishment of debt. the company defines adjusted net income as net income excluding, gain and losses from disposal of assets, store closure and exit costs, public offering expenses , the loss on extinguishment of debt and the related tax impact of those adjustments. for the first quarter of 2016, such further adjustments to net income and ebitda were immaterial; thus only ebitda is presented.

these non-gaap measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard meanings prescribed by gaap. use of these terms may differ from similar measures reported by other companies. because of their limitations, none of these non-gaap measures should be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to use to reinvest in growth of the company's business, or as a measure of cash that will be available to meet the company's obligations. each of these non-gaap measures has its limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under gaap.

(a) store closure and exit costs represents reserves established for closed stores and facilities, adjustments to those reserves for changes in expectations for sublease or actual subleases or settlements with landlords. ongoing expenses related with the closed facilities are also included. the company excluded store closure and exit costs from its adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to provide period-to-period comparability of its operating results because management believed these costs did not directly reflect the ongoing performance of its store operations.

(b) loss on disposal of assets represents the losses recorded in connection with the disposal of property and equipment. the company excluded losses on disposals of assets from its adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to provide period-to-period comparability of its operating results because management believed these costs did not directly reflect the ongoing performance of its store operations.

(c) secondary offering expenses including employment taxes on options exercises represents expenses the company incurred in its secondary public offerings and employment taxes paid by the company in connection with options exercised in those offerings. the company excluded these items from its adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income to provide period-to-period comparability of its operating results because management believed these costs did not directly reflect the performance of its store operations.

(d) adjusted income tax provision for all periods presented represents the income tax provision plus the tax effect of the adjustments described in notes (a) through (d) above based on statutory tax rates for the period. the company excluded these items from its adjusted income tax provision because management believed they did not directly reflect the ongoing performance of its store operations and were not reflective of its ongoing income tax provision.

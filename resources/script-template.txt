// A line that starts with either "//" or "#" is a comment line and is ignored
// A "//" or "#" in the middle of a line starts a comment and effectively ends the line
// Blanks or tabs at the end of a line or at the beginning or end of a parameter are ignored
// An emptyline or end of file mark terminates the program
//
// You must always start by specifying the total number of documents, so that Copyfind allocates the proper amount of memory
Documents,2
//
// Next, you must specify the reporting folder, so that Copyfind can start to maintain its logs and records
ReportFolder,F:\Users\Vito\Desktop\test copyfind\res	// the report folder should go next
//
// Now you can begin to specify documents and comparison specificationsin any order you like
//
// Each document entry has two parameters: <Group>,<FileName/DirectoryName>
// <Group> is any integer except 0 (empty) and specifies the group of documents to which the present document(s) belongs
// <FileName> is the full filename of the document; <DirectoryName> is the full filename of the directory containing a collection of documents
//
// In this example, I specify four of the documents individually, like this:
Document,1,F:\Users\Vito\Desktop\test copyfind\docs	// put docs in Group 1
//
// the comparison specfiers have default values, set by the Documents command, but you can change them explicitly as follows:
PhraseLength,6		// default 6
WordThreshold,6		// default 100
SkipLength,20		// default 20
MismatchTolerance,2	// default 2
MismatchPercentage,80	// default 80
BriefReport,0		// default 0 = No/False (note that: 1 = Yes/True)
IgnoreCase,0		// default 0 = No/False (note that: 1 = Yes/True)
IgnoreNumbers,0		// default 0 = No/False (note that: 1 = Yes/True)
IgnoreOuterPunctuation,0	// default 0 = No/False (note that: 1 = Yes/True)
IgnorePunctuation,0	// default 0 = No/False (note that: 1 = Yes/True)
SkipLongWords,0		// default 0 = No/False (note that: 1 = Yes/True)
SkipNonwords,0		// default 0 = No/False (note that: 1 = Yes/True)
//
// You can also set the locale, to work with other languages. It must be a recognized locale (see WCopyfind for the list)
Locale,English		// default English
//
// Once you have specified all the documents and the comparison specifications, you need to initialize the comparison processes
PrepareForComparisons	// loads the documents and gets ready to run comparisons
//
// Now, you can compare groups of documents against one another, or compare one group internally
//
// This next comparison compares each document in group1 against each document in group2:
//Compare,1,4	// Compare group1 documents against group4 documents (no internal group comparisons)
//
// This next comparison compares each document in group 1 against all the other documents in group1
Compare,1,1	// Compare group1 documents internally against one another
//
// When you are done comparing the current collection of documents, you can finish up the entire operation and close all the report files, etc.
Done	// Finish everything and deallocates the entire document collection so that Copyfind can start again fresh
//
// I could now start afresh with another "Documents..." commend, etc. (just as though we were starting Copyfind fresh
